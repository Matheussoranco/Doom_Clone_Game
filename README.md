# Doom_Clone_Game
This is a Doom_Clone as a project for my Computer-human interaction course on university in 2022-2. This was based on the Carmack code of the game. I will not post the resources i used since i don't own any of them. To run, just create a resources file and inside of it you put:
-Create a sound file, where you put your mp4
-A textures file, where you put the .png
-A sprites file, where you create files for NPc's, weapons and objects
